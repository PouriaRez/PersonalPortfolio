          <div class="project-desc">
            LockIn is a productivity app developed by our team as part of the
            Google Developers Club (GDC) at UCSC for a quarter-long hackathon,
            competing against other GDC teams. Designed for students and
            entrepreneurs, LockIn combines social media elements with a unique
            progress tracking system. Users can capture and share daily photos
            of their work, whether it's academic, business-related, or personal,
            and showcase their progress to friends and family. By setting daily
            goals and receiving social encouragement, LockIn helps users stay on
            track while building a community that celebrates productivity.

          <div class="project-desc">
            Developing expertise involves tacit knowledge that can only be
            acquired through real-world situated practice. But internships and
            other forms of apprenticeship learning are hard to scale and
            inaccessible to those with little prior experience. To address this,
            we are building Causeway, an app based on a structure we call
            micro-role hierarchies. Causeway allows anyone to work on small
            roles that contribute to real-world projects and that sequence
            predictably to professional skills. In a pilot, we showed that
            novices were able to successfully build 3 static views of webapps
            for non-profits. We are now exploring how to extend this as a
            powerful medium for learning and for supporting community causes.

          <h3>Slack</h3>

          <div class="project-desc">
            Developing production-grade software skills requires real-world
            experience that is often difficult to obtain without prior exposure.
            To bridge this gap, I built a full-stack Slack clone—a messaging
            platform modeled after real-world team collaboration tools. The
            project uses React and Material UI to create a responsive,
            accessible interface, with Node.js and Express powering the backend
            APIs, fully documented via OpenAPI. I integrated a PostgreSQL
            database to manage users, messages, and channels with relational
            integrity. This project gave me hands-on experience with scalable
            architecture, component-based UI design, RESTful API development,
            and database modeling, closely simulating the workflow of modern
            professional software teams.

          <h3>From Curiosity to Creation</h3>
          <p>
            Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by computers. What
            started as hours spent playing around with machines turned into a
            lifelong passion for technology. This curiosity laid the foundation
            for my journey into software development and computer science.
          </p>
          <h3>Education and Growth</h3>
          <p>
            I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at
            the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). My academic journey
            has been both challenging and rewarding, as I dive deep into topics
            like algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. Despite
            the occasional hurdles—like late nights debugging code— I remain
            motivated by the excitement of solving problems and building tools
            that make an impact.
          </p>
          <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve developed strong skills in C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and frameworks like ReactJS, React Native, Angular, and
            TypeScript. I’m experienced with tools like Tailwind CSS, PostCSS,
            and Bootstrap to build responsive interfaces. With a focus on
            full-stack development, I integrate front-end designs with back-end
            solutions.
          </p>
          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>
            I aspire to use my skills to create software solutions that make a
            difference—whether through automating tasks, enhancing user
            experiences, or solving real-world problems. My portfolio showcases
            projects that align with this vision and demonstrate my growth as a
            developer.
          </p>
          <h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Technology never stands still, and neither do I. Every day, I
            dedicate time to improving my skills, exploring new tools, and
            staying updated with industry trends. I believe that growth is a
            continuous process, and I’m excited about the journey ahead.
