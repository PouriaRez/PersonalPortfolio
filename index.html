                        LockIn is a productivity app developed by our team as part of the Google Developers Club (GDC) at UCSC for a quarter-long hackathon,
                         competing against other GDC teams. Designed for students and entrepreneurs, 
                         LockIn combines social media elements with a unique progress tracking system. 
                         Users can capture and share daily photos of their work, whether it's academic,
                         business-related, or personal, and showcase their progress to friends and family.
                         By setting daily goals and receiving social encouragement,
                         LockIn helps users stay on track while building a community that celebrates productivity.

                    Developing expertise involves tacit knowledge that can only be acquired through real-world situated practice.
                     But internships and other forms of apprenticeship learning are hard to scale and inaccessible to those with little prior experience.
                      To address this, we are building Causeway, an app based on a structure we call micro-role hierarchies.
                       Causeway allows anyone to work on small roles that contribute to real-world projects and that sequence predictably to professional skills.
                        In a pilot, we showed that novices were able to successfully build 3 static views of webapps for non-profits. We are now exploring how to extend this as a powerful medium for learning and for supporting community causes.
