                        LockIn is a productivity app developed by our team as part of the Google Developers Club (GDC) at UCSC for a quarter-long hackathon,
                         competing against other GDC teams. Designed for students and entrepreneurs, 
                         LockIn combines social media elements with a unique progress tracking system. 
                         Users can capture and share daily photos of their work, whether it's academic,
                         business-related, or personal, and showcase their progress to friends and family.
                         By setting daily goals and receiving social encouragement,
                         LockIn helps users stay on track while building a community that celebrates productivity.

                    Developing expertise involves tacit knowledge that can only be acquired through real-world situated practice.
                     But internships and other forms of apprenticeship learning are hard to scale and inaccessible to those with little prior experience.
                      To address this, we are building Causeway, an app based on a structure we call micro-role hierarchies.
                       Causeway allows anyone to work on small roles that contribute to real-world projects and that sequence predictably to professional skills.
                        In a pilot, we showed that novices were able to successfully build 3 static views of webapps for non-profits. We are now exploring how to extend this as a powerful medium for learning and for supporting community causes.

                    <h3>From Curiosity to Creation</h3>
                        <p>Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by computers. 
                            What started as hours spent playing around with machines turned into a lifelong passion for technology. 
                            This curiosity laid the foundation for my journey into software development and computer science.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Education and Growth</h3>
                        <p>
                            I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC).
                             My academic journey has been both challenging and rewarding, as I dive deep into topics like algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. 
                             Despite the occasional hurdles—like late nights debugging code—
                             I remain motivated by the excitement of solving problems and building tools that make an impact.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
                        <p>
                            I’ve developed strong skills in C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                            and frameworks like ReactJS, React Native, Angular, and TypeScript.
                             I’m experienced with tools like Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Bootstrap to build responsive interfaces.
                              With a focus on full-stack development, I integrate front-end designs with back-end solutions.

                        </p>
                    <h3>Vision</h3>
                        <p>
                            I aspire to use my skills to create software solutions that make a difference—whether through automating tasks,
                            enhancing user experiences, or solving real-world problems.
                             My portfolio showcases projects that align with this vision and demonstrate my growth as a developer.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        Technology never stands still, and neither do I.
                         Every day, I dedicate time to improving my skills, exploring new tools, and staying updated with industry trends.
                          I believe that growth is a continuous process, and I’m excited about the journey ahead.
